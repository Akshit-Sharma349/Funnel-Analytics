# Product & Funnel Analytics Dashboard

A portfolio-grade product analytics project simulating a food delivery app (similar to Zomato/Swiggy). Built to demonstrate SQL, Power BI, and DAX skills relevant to product and data analyst roles.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a simulated food delivery app's user journey — from app open to order completion. It covers funnel analysis, retention, cohort analysis, and user segmentation across 50,000 users and ~1.47 million events over 6 months.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Python | Synthetic data generation |
| MySQL | Database, schema, SQL views |
| Power BI | Dashboard, DAX measures |
| DAX | KPI calculations |

---

## Dataset

Synthetically generated using Python — simulates a real food delivery app event stream.

| Table | Rows | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| users | 50,000 | User profiles, city, device, channel |
| sessions | ~325,000 | User sessions |
| events | ~1,470,000 | Raw event stream |
| orders | ~112,000 | Completed transactions |
| user_segments | ~44,000 | Monthly user segmentation |

**Event funnel:**
```
app_open → search → restaurant_view → add_to_cart → checkout_initiated → payment_attempted → order_completed
```

## SQL

### Tables
- `users`, `sessions`, `events`, `orders`, `user_segments`

### Views
| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| vw_funnel_analysis | Step-wise funnel conversion & drop-off |
| vw_dau_wau_mau | Daily, weekly, monthly active users |
| vw_retention_analysis | Weekly retention by cohort |
| vw_cohort_analysis | Monthly cohort retention |
| vw_user_segmentation | User segments with RFM-style metrics |
| vw_cart_abandonment | Cart abandonment rate & value |

**Key SQL concepts used:** CTEs, Window Functions, LAG, LEAD, ROW_NUMBER, FIRST_VALUE, PARTITION BY
